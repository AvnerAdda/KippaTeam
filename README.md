"# KippaTeam" 
This is our program. We import different information from the website: Toward Data Science (https://towardsdatascience.com/)
The first dataframe is the basics information from the home page of each topic (Data Science, AI, Programming, ...)
The second dataframe is the authors of each articles, we have the names of the authors, the date of subscription, the
number of followers et followings and if he has social media
The third dataframe is the articles details. It gives additional information about the articles like claps and tags

The final objective is to analyse these data.

Enjoy.
